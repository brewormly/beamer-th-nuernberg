# A Beamer Latex Template for Presentations at TH Nürnberg
This template provides useful features to create presentations for lectures of the TH Nürnberg using LaTeX.

Originally this template was created by students of the TU Munich. Nevertheless I find this adapted version very useful.

Feel free to add improvements to this template and do what ever you want with it. Pull requests are welcome.
